            <p>I like to program.</p>
<p>The act of programming allows me to enter a state of flow
and I find nothing more enjoyable than whiling the hours away as I dig into a
complicated development task. Luckily I have been able to find a productive
avenue for this passion and in this section, I will highlight five different
web applications that I have had to pleasure to build. Each has not only been
incorporated in courses at Winona State, but is also open-sourced and freely
available to anyone on the web. Furthermore, they are build using modern
technology to be fast, portable, and affordable.</p>
<h2 id="web-applications-for-introducing-statistical-inference">Web Applications for Introducing Statistical Inference</h2>
<p>Most statistics faculty at WSU use a pedagogical approach pioneered by Drs.
Malone and Hook, where the idea of statistical evidence is introduced using
random simulations on categorical studies. Subsequently, these ideas are
formalized initially using the exact binomial test and later on in the
semester with procedures such as a t-test or chi-square test.</p>
<p>There are several advantages to this approach. First, it avoids the details
of more complicated procedures like the t or chi-square tests. Also,
this approach allows the introduce core concepts of statistical inference <em>much</em>
earlier than more traditional approaches, where these ideas appear in
the final third of course.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are two problems with the technologies that was
traditionally used to implement this pedagogy here at WSU and these first
three web applications were built to address these issues.</p>
<p>A number of my colleagues have used these applications in their courses and I
have received positive feedback from many. For example, here are comments
from Dr. Kerby (drawn from her review of my year 2019-2020 PDR).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Todd has spent a lot of time using his programming expertise to design and
implement; two experimental design and one simulation applet. I have used the
simulation applet in my STAT 110 course, in addition to his exact binomial exact
test applet created previously, and I think they are great! It’s easy
for students to build a better understanding with no cost to them; all they
need is the internet. I find the simulation applet very easy and straight
forward for the students to use.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here is what Dr. Tisha Hooks had to say in her <a href="/testimonial/hooks_letter_of_support.pdf/">letter of
support</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&hellip; Todd has gone above and beyond to also improve our statistics program. One
specific example I’d like to highlight is his creation of web applets that
are now used across almost all sections of introductory statistics on campus.
Before these applets were available, I required my students to purchase a
program (which cost them about $8) that was used to run simulation studies
(these simulation studies are used to intuitively introduce the idea of
statistical inference). The software was easy to use for most students, but
some did struggle and ended up falling behind early in the course. Todd
identified this added cost to the students and the issues some students had
using the program as hurdles to their learning, and he decided to do
something about it. He created a beta version of his own applet, asked us to
test it and give feedback, and then made the final version available for free
on the web. I have been using this binomial simulation study applet in my
introductory courses for about a year now, and it is fantastic. Not only is
it free, but it’s much easier for students to learn and use than the software
I used previously. In addition, he created another applet that simplifies the
computation of binomial probabilities that is now a part of several
introductory courses, as well. His applets have made my courses better, and
my students and I both owe him a great deal of gratitude.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the coming sections, I will highlight each web application.</p>
<h4 id="the-binomial-simulation-app">The Binomial Simulation App</h4>
<p>This <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/binomial_simulation/">binomial simulation
app</a> was built to
replace Tinkerplots and facilitate our approach to looking for statistical
evidence through random simulations.
<a href="https://www.tinkerplots.com">TinkerPlots</a> program was the original
vehicle for performing simulations, but has some drawbacks. It requires
students to purchase a license through a website hosted in Australia
(students&rsquo; banks occasionally decline the international purchase), has an
non-intuitive interface, and currently doesn't support the newest
versions of macOS. On top of these issues, creating simulations in
Tinkerplots is overly complicated and simulations take a VERY long time
to run.</p>

  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>This application was quickly adopted by a number of my colleagues over the
last few years. It is modern, running on the client-side in the user’s
browser, more intuitive, and is FAST! Students master this
application much quicker than Tinkerplots and running 1+ million trials takes
seconds; where TinkerPlots took minutes to perform 1,000 trials and would
crash if you tried many more trials.</p>
<p>Allowing for a very large number of trials reduces the variability in the
simulation outcomes. I would argue that this reduces the overall cognitive
load, as there is no need to account for the variability between two
student’s results. Furthermore, a large number of trials also facilitates
talking about the law of large numbers and moving on to the exact binomial
test.</p>
<h4 id="a-web-applications-for-the-exact-binomial-test">A Web Applications for the Exact Binomial Test</h4>
<p>The Hooks-Malone approach transitions from the less-formal, more initiative
simulations to the more-formal exact binomial test. Unfortunately, the
technology used to run the exact binomial test varied from instructor to
instructor and was frankly fairly clunky. Some instructors used a spread
sheet to compute and add up individual probabilities (overly complicated in
my view) and others relied on JMP to compute a p-value (a black box with its
own quirks). I set out to create an application that would allow students to
quickly and easily complete the p-value for the exact binomial test while
still providing a bridge to understanding the connection between simulations
and this procedure.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/exact_binomial/">exact binomial web
application</a>, allows
students to compute the p-value for the exact binomial test (see <strong>Figure
2</strong>). Similar to the binomial simulation application, this app is fast,
intuitive, free, affordable to maintain, and available on any device with a
modern browser. The application is also being used by Dr. Silas Bergen (STAT 110)
and Dr. Tisha Hooks (STAT 110, STAT 210, and STAT 310).</p>

<p>I have also created a <a href="https://yardsale8.github.io/exact_binomial_power/">second
application</a> which builds
on the exact binomial application and focuses on computing the Type I error
rate and power for an exact binomial test (see <strong>Figure 3</strong>). This application
is used in STAT 310 by myself and Dr. Hooks.</p>

<p>The final application, the <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/categorical_bootstrap/">categorical bootstrap
app</a> is the latest
addition and rounds out my suite of client-side web applications for one
sample categorial data.  This application allows students to apply <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping_%28statistics%29">the bootstrap</a> to scenarios involving a single categorial sample and provides an intuitive method for introducing the concept of a confidence interval.</p>
<p>Many of the faculty at Winona State use the <a href="http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/">StatKey web
apps</a> as part of out class, but the
<a href="http://www.lock5stat.com/StatKey/">StatKey CI for a Proportion</a> app has some
shortcomings, namely the interface for entering and subsequent lack of a plot
of the data. I address these issues with this application and have
subsequently replaced the StatKey app in STAT 110.</p>
<h2 id="web-applications-for-designing-and-running-virtual-experiments">Web Applications for Designing and Running Virtual Experiments</h2>
<p>STAT 321 Industrial Design of Experiments is a course focused on teaching
students to design, implement, and analyze experiments. My colleagues have
designed a suite of &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; experiments intended to provide students
with hands-on experience implementing and running an experiment from
start to finish. These labs are a standard part of my design for face-to-face
sections of STAT 321, but the response to Covid-19 threw a wrench in my
original plans last spring semester. It is hard to fire catapults or drop
helicopters virtually.</p>
<p>To replicate the experience of designing and running experiments virtually, I
have developed two web apps that simulate an ultrasonic welding experiment
(linked below). <a href="https://medcraveonline.com/MSEIJ/modeling-and-prediction-of-weld-strength-in-ultrasonic-metal-welding-process-using-artificial-neural-network-and-multiple-regression-method.html">Anand et al.
(2018)</a>,
conducted an ultrasonic welding experiment and then fit a multivariate
regression model to the results. My web application is based on their regression model and
provide a random, repeatable simulation of this process. An important feature of
this model is there is a nice local maximum inside the design space,
allowing for the application of response surface designs.</p>

<p>The two applications are illustrated in <strong>Figure 8</strong>, where <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/weld_strength_experiment/">left-hand
application</a>
facilitates a full or fractional factorial design, while <a href="https://wsu-datascience.github.io/welding_strength_blocking/">right-hand
application</a>
adds an imaginary operator to allow for blocked designs.</p>
<p>I have several additions that I would like to make to these applications.
First, I would like to improve the underlying model, perhaps by using some of
the other models found in the literature. Second, I would like to add the
option to perform trials at center or radial points, which would facilitate a
broader range of designs. There are also tentative plans to add additional
factors, covariates, temporal effects, and/or other information (like cost
and time) to allow for wider application. Finally, I also plan to abstract my
current code to allow turn this site into a framework that can be applied to
another scenario without much of a hassle. This would allow me to build an
entire suite of virtual experiments that are open source and can be shared
with the statistics education community.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this section, evidence was provided of substantial contributions in the
area of technologically delivered academic products (See Appendix G of the
Master Agreement) in the form of six web applications that are used my
colleagues, as well as my own, courses. Each web app is modern, fast, and
easy to use; and all are freely available on the web on any device with a
modern browser.</p>

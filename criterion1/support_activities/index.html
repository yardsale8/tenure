<p>In August of 2019, I was informed that one of my STAT 110 students was
hearing impaired and required closed captioning on all video lectures. Making
this accommodation was no small task, as I run this course using the flipped
classroom; with a large number of short (or so I thought) lecture videos.
Luckily, MediaSpace offers a machine captioning service that guarantees 70%
accuracy. This service is available to anyone at no cost and a request can be
made by simply navigating to <strong>Caption &amp; Enrich</strong> and clicking <strong>Submit</strong>
with the default settings (<strong>Figure 1</strong>)</p>

    <strong>Figure 2</strong>. While machine captioning does a pretty good job of translation, it has trouble translating math and has no way of knowing that “jump” is JMP.
  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>While machine captioning is a good place to start, it has trouble
translating technical terms (e.g. standard deviation) or JMP (the
software used in STAT 110—which is pronounced “jump”). <strong>Figure 2</strong> shows
some examples of mistakes in machine captioning of one of my recent
videos for STAT 321.</p>

  <a data-fancybox="" href="/img/caption3.png" data-caption="Figure 3. Navigating to Caption &amp; Enrich and clicking the edit icon opens the Closed Caption Editor; which allows you to edit the original translation while watching your video.">

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 3.</strong> Navigating to Caption &amp; Enrich and clicking the edit icon opens the Closed Caption Editor; which allows you to edit the original translation while watching your video.
  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>After reviewing the first few translations, I realized that corrections were
needed, which can be accomplished using another MediaSpace tool. Once a
machine translation has completed, navigating back to <strong>Caption &amp; Enrich</strong>
(Figure 1) will allow you to edit the translation by clicking the edit icon;
which opens the Closed Caption Editor (<strong>Figure 3</strong>). This tool allows you to
edit the original translation while watching the video.</p>
<p>While this is a fairly straight forward process, captioning all 85 videos
from STAT 110 was a Herculean task. Even though it was a TON of extra work, I
am glad that I had the experience as I learned several valuable lessons in
the process. First, captioning 20-minute videos made the need for short
videos crystal clear. There were times when faced with a particularly long
video, I found it easier to just make a new, short video. <em>What clearer
indication could there be that a video is too long?</em></p>
<p>Besides highlighting some poor speaking habits (“um”; starting sentences
with “so”) and a tendency to talk too fast; I also realized that habits
that I developed giving live lectures for 20 years do not necessarily
translate to videos. In particular, I found that I tend to
repeat myself when making important points. I don’t think this is a bad
habit when giving live lectures because we all lose focus and forget
parts of any lecture. What I am starting to believe is that this habit
is counterproductive in a video lecture, as the ability to watch the
video again removes the need for a repetitious speaker.</p>

</figure>

<p>The process of watching and captioning 85 of my lecture videos
(<strong>Figure 4</strong>) has made me much more mindful of the viewer's needs and much
more dedicated to producing short, quality clear videos. Replaying and
editing new videos in Camtasia has become mandatory and I have also
started to add machine captions to all new videos. Luckily, making a
conscious effort to slow down and avoid my bad verbal habits has led to
better initial translations and hopefully a better experience for the
learner.</p>
<p>Next, I will discuss my on-going efforts to keep a teaching journal.</p>
<h3 id="using-google-calendar-as-a-teaching-journal">Using Google Calendar as a Teaching Journal</h3>
<p>As mentioned in earlier PDP/PDRs, I have been looking for a sustainable
method of keeping a teaching journal. In the past, I have tried a number
of approaches including keeping a journal in Apple Notes and using an
iOS journaling app. I wasn’t able to make a habit out of any of the
approaches.</p>













<figure>


  <a data-fancybox="" href="/img/calendar.png" data-caption="Figure 1: Each class is given its own Google Calendar (left-hand side) and all-day events are used for each class session (right-hand side).">

  <figcaption>
    <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Each class is given its own Google Calendar (left-hand side) and all-day events are used for each class session (right-hand side).
  </figcaption>


</figure>

<p>For the last two semesters, I have been using events in my Google
Calendar to keep a journal for each class. While I haven’t developed
the habit of completing these entries every day, I have been able to keep up
enough (say 2/3 of all class periods) to suggest this approach is
sustainable.</p>
<p>To illustrate my process, please note that I have created a Google
Calendar for each of my courses (Figure 1 – left-hand side). For each
class session, an all-day event is created for the session, where the
name of the event gives a hint at the material covered that day (Figure
1 – right-hand side). The actual journal for each class session is kept
in the notes section of each event. Minimally, these notes outline the
material covered that day; but generally, also include information about
how the session(s) went, improvements made between/after each session,
and suggestions for future improvements. See Figure 2 for two examples
of the journal entries.</p>

<h3 id="tracking-grading-progress">Tracking Grading Progress</h3>
<p>As mentioned in earlier PDRs, moving to a paperless approach to teaching
has had one unfortunate consequence: It is harder to track grading
progress. In the past, papers would pile up … anxiety would build … and
grading would occur. Now that everything is digital, I have lost the
physical reminder to keep on grading.</p>

<p>This last fall, I implemented a persistent visual reminder of my grading
progress. On the whiteboard in my office, I keep a list of outstanding
items in need of grading. I generally assign two types of assignments,
regular items and items that are graded on completion. Items that are
graded on completion are differentiated by a * and grading one of these
“counts” for about 1/3 of a regular assignment. My goal is to grade 1-2
regular items a day.</p>
<p>While this method has made it easier to track my progress, I
have yet to check the “Caught Up” box more than a couple of times a
semester. Frankly, this last year was a pretty busy year, due to the
development a new course each semester, and I look forward to seeing how
well this approach works during a regular year.</p>

          <h1>Curriculum Design</h1>

          <div class="article-style">
            <p>When first joining the faculty as Winona State, I was very excited to learn
about and contribute to the curriculum of the data science program. Over the
course of the last four years, I have had a substantial impact on this
curriculum.</p>
<p>In her <a href="/testimonial/hooks_letter_of_support.pdf">letter of support</a>,
Dr. Hooks stressed these contributions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our data science program has significantly improved since Todd joined our
faculty. He created two new courses on his own to fill gaping holes in the
curriculum, which is a daunting and time-demanding task. Furthermore, he also
worked with other faculty members to improve existing data science courses.
His expertise is valued by us all, and we often seek out his advice. Todd is
always willing to offer ideas and opinions to his colleagues - even for
courses he is not currently teaching - no matter how busy he is with his own
teaching assignment. He is committed to making our courses better, regardless
of whether he is the one teaching them or not, and his efforts have had a
positive impact.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the contributions he has made to our data
science program alone along with the work he’s done to share his ideas with
the larger data science/statistics community are enough to warrant tenure and
promotion, but Todd has gone above and beyond to also improve our statistics program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As eluded to in Dr. Hook's comments, I have also made contributions to the
statistics curriculum, evidenced by the learning applications discussed in
one of the sections for <a href="/criterion2/software/">criterion 2</a>,
the STAT 310 project discussed in the section on <a href="/criterion1/instructional_innovation/">instructional
innovation</a>, and my work
aligning the curriculum of STAT 110 and STAT 210 discussed below.</p>
<p>In informal conversations, Dr. Chris Malone has indicated that he hoped that
adding me to the faculty would lead to improvements in
the data science curriculum in general and students&rsquo; programming skills in particular. By the
end of this section, you will have seen evidence of my contributions in both
of these areas; as well as examples of my contributions made to the
statistic program.</p>
<h2 id="curriculum-development-for-data-science">Curriculum Development for Data Science</h2>
<p>First, I will discuss my primary contributions to the data science
curriculum, which comes in the form of two new courses and a revamped
curriculum for the introductory data science course. In the following
sections, I will discuss the creation of DSCI 330 and DSCI 430, give an
overview of the revamped DSCI 210 curriculum, and finally discussing my
efforts to improve students&rsquo; programming skills throughout these three
courses.</p>

<p><strong>Course Description.</strong> This course will give students an overview of the
issues related to the management of unstructured data, that is any data that
is not stored in a table or database. Sources of unstructured data include
bodies of text, social media applications, images, and audio. In the process
of exploring various forms of unstructured data, students will be exposed to
new programming languages and tools that are useful for managing this type of
data (e.g. Python and bash). Other topics covered in the course include web
scraping, natural language processing, and manipulating images/videos/audio
files.</p>
<p><strong>Rationale.</strong> This course fills a void in the previous curriculum.
It is estimated that between 50% and 80% of new data is unstructured (see
<a href="http://breakthroughanalysis.com/2008/08/01/unstructured-data-and-the-80-percent-rule/">Unstructured Data and the 80%
Rule</a>.
Current and future data scientists will rely on the skills needed to gain
insight from these data sources. Before adding these courses, the program had
several offerings that provided students with experience working with
structured data, but there was little exposure to unstructured data.</p>
<p>This course is designed to expose students to the methods and techniques
necessary to work with unstructured data. Students in the course learn to
process various types of unstructured data: text, data from the web,
audio, images, and video.</p>
<p>My colleague Dr. Silas Bergen sat in on DSCI 330 this fall and had
the following comments in his <a href="/testimonial/bergen_letter_of_support.pdf">letter of
support</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Iverson has also developed two entirely new, upper-level courses to our
curriculum (DSCI 330: Management of Unstructured Data and DSCI 430: Data at
Scale). I was able to sit in on DSCI 330 last semester and learned a lot
about the challenges students will face with messy data in the workplace and
the Python coding tools they can use to tackle those challenges. These are
both very strong courses and stellar additions to our Data Science
curriculum. Suffice to say, Dr. Iverson has been a boon for our Data Science
program.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All of the material for the course can be found on <a href="https://github.com/wsu-DSCI330">the DSCI 330 GitHub
organization</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Course Description.</strong> The focus of this course is on exposing students to
processing data on a large scale using a distributed platform. First,
students will learn the functional approach to processing large data sets.
Along the way, we will encounter many of the techniques that are employed in
large distributed data-processing systems, such as using common higher-order
functions, employing lazy evaluation, and relying on immutable data
structures. By the end of the course students will be familiar with
processing large amounts of data in one or more high-level languages (e.g.
Python and/or Scala) and working with several frameworks for distributed
computation (e.g. Hadoop/MapReduce/Spark).</p>
<p><strong>Rationale.</strong> This course filled a second void in the previous DSCI curriculum,
which lacked coverage of working with data on a large scale, that is data
that is too large to process on a single machine. This is a problem
with most data science programs, which become apparent when judging data
analytics competitions such as MUDAC and MinneMUDAC. I aimed to correct
this problem with this course.</p>
<p>Students in this course are introduced to working with data at three
different scales. First, they learn to process data relatively small data
(i.e. fits in RAM) using the standard Python tools of Pandas and the dfply
libraries. Next, students work with data that is too large to hold in RAM, but
can be processed on a single machine using a SQL database. Finally, students
work with PySpark, which can work with massive amounts of
data, data so large it must be distributed across the hard drives of many
machines.</p>
<p>In the process of working with these three different platforms, we reinforce
an idea that was first introduced in DSCI 210, that is &ldquo;it's all the
same stuff&rdquo;&ndash;that data management is translating the same general processes
to different platforms. While I am in the processes of updating the material for
this semesters class, the materials from the 2019 course can be found on the

<h3 id="teaching-students-to-write-better-code">Teaching Students to Write Better Code</h3>
<p>The secondary aim of these courses was to introduce students to a new
programming language and improve their programming skills. Strong programming
skills are a requirement for data scientists. Trends in data science tend to
move quickly and future data scientists must be exposed to many programming
languages and develop the ability to learn new languages or platforms.
Furthermore, developing the ability to write clean, correct, and
well-documented code will make students more efficient and valuable members
of a team.</p>
<p>To meet these aims, course material in DSCI 330 and DSCI 430 is supplemented
with lectures on writing better code, including selecting good names, writing
unit tests and proper documentation, and refactoring to clean up code. Also,
students are introduced to the data science modern toolset, including
technologies such as git, GitHub, Jupyter notebooks, and Docker.  I am pleased
to say that I have had multiple students thank me for helping them become
better programmers. For example, here is an email I received from Shane Will,
who graduated with a double major in computer science and data science,
shortly after taking my course.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Good Evening Dr. Iverson,</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to thank you for pushing me in the Python course this past
spring. I have realized that my programming skills have really improved after
being pushed to write in a functional style. I know that if it was not for
that class and your pushing me I would not have improved my development
style. Thanks again and I hope that your summer has been going well</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Shane Will</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another recent data science graduate, Mariah Quam, in her <a href="/testimonial/quam_letter_of_support.pdf">letter of
support</a> for this proposal, had to
say after taking three of my programming course (including DSCI 330 and 430).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are specifically three coding classes I took with Professor Iverson
that allowed me to accrue exponential growth in my coding ability. Through
these classes, he showed his ability to make what should have been boring and
tough lecture topics into engaging and thought provoking class periods by
using his great sense of humor and interactive approaches. On top of being a
great professor in the classroom, he shined through his office hours just as
much as he did in the classroom. I commend him for the amount of patience I
have witnessed him to have first hand with me and also with other students.
One thing I love about Professor Iverson is he truly cares about his
students&rsquo; learning. He is not one to just give a student the answer to get
them out of his face or to leave them high and dry with no help. He is the
definition of going the extra mile when it comes to teaching students the
process of coding.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that I presented some of these ideas at SDSS
2019, which is discussed <a href="/criterion2/presentations/">elsewhere</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-of-a-project-based-and-concept-driven-curriculum-for-dsci-210">Implementation of a Project-Based and Concept-Driven Curriculum for DSCI 210</h3>
<p>Developing the two new DSCI courses, as well as advising and judging with
students in data analytics competitions, had the added benefit of clarifying
what data science is all about and formalizing a set of beliefs in how it
should be taught. A summary of these beliefs follows.</p>
<p><strong>Software-agnostic data management.</strong> Many books and courses on data science focus
on teaching specific technologies or platforms, but we focus on giving students
a general abstract vocabulary for solving data management and visualization
tasks, then translating this language to specific technologies. DSCI 210 now
incorporates this approach by teaching data management verbs, then
translating these verbs to JMP, OpenRefine, and R.</p>
<p><strong>Honoring the 80%.</strong> It is often noted that a data scientist will
spend 80% of their time managing data and only 20% of their time later
analyzing the data. While many courses devote much of their time to teaching
the tools for the final analyses, we believe that data curriculum should
<em>honor the 80%</em>, that is provide substantial and focused training that
prepares them for this 80% of their work life. While DSCI 210 still provides
an introduction to data visualization and statistical learning, a majority of
the curriculum is devoted to data management.</p>
<p><strong>Project-based learning.</strong> Finally, we believe students learning is
*reinforced by tackling complicated problems. To facilitate this learning,
*DSCI 210 now includes multiple projects that allow students to apply what
*they have learned to real-world problems, as well as practice presenting
*their findings.</p>
<p>Over the last two years, I had the opportunity to incorporate these into a
revamped curriculum for DSCI 210, the introductory course in data
science.  After polishing the new curriculum over two semesters, I handed the course off to my colleague Dr. Silas Bergen, who had this to say about the results.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I will specifically speak to my own personal experience teaching DSCI 210,
our introductory Data Science course, for the first time in Fall 2019. When
we first offered this course prior to Dr. Iverson’s arrival at Winona State,
we were very much “feeling around in the dark” with the course. Data Science
was a very new field in general, and there was little in the way of
established curriculum upon which to base the course. However, by the time I
taught the course, after Dr. Iverson had taught it several times, it had
developed into a very impressive course. Its conceptual flow was strong and
the assignments were high-quality, effectively reinforcing class concepts.
Dr. Iverson had discovered an important data cleaning tool, OpenRefine, and
introduced it to the course. Students glommed onto this tool and used it in
subsequent data analytics competitions. OpenRefine is now a mainstay of the
course. But Dr. Iverson’s most important contributions to this course, and to
the Data Science curriculum as a whole, is a “software agnostic” philosophy.
“Data Science” is not the learning of tools, or a pedagogy centered around
e.g. “learning how to code in Python” (though these tools are definitely
important). Rather Dr. Iverson has helped us as a department realize that
Data Science has theoretical and conceptual foundations that transcend any
one tool, and advocated for a curricular approach that exposes students to a
variety of tools with the idea that they should use the right tool for the
job. This has greatly strengthened our program and this philosophy touches
all aspects of our curriculum, from management of structured data to data
visualization.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Last semester, I had the opportunity to teach DSCI 210 again; this time
taking advantage of the excellent additions added by Dr. Bergen. The course
is finally in an excellent place, as evidenced by the following student
evaluation comments.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&ldquo;I really enjoyed this class and ending up adding Data Science to be my second major. I thought you did a wonderful job teaching and I feel like I learned so many useful tools to apply to my other studies in this class. Thank you so much!&quot;</em></li>
<li><em>&ldquo;This course made me consider getting a major in DSCI. I HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend this course to other students.&quot;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="curriculum-development-for-statistics">Curriculum Development for Statistics</h2>
<p>Finally, I would like to highlight some of the curricula I developed for the
statistics program. In addition to the project I developed for STAT 310 in the
section on <a href="/criterion1/instructional_innovation/">instructional innovation</a>, I also spent some time
aligning the curriculum between my STAT 110 and STAT 210 courses, in an
attempt to better understand issues with substituting one course for another.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-bridge-between-stat-110-and-stat-210-curriculum">Creating a Bridge Between STAT 110 and STAT 210 Curriculum</h3>
<p>I am always looking for efficiencies in the implementation of the many class
preparations. One semester, I had two sections of STAT 210 on the same day as a
STAT 110 section and I determined that these courses could be designed to
share about 80% of the same content, meaning that for 80% of these courses
could be considered a single preparation.</p>
<p>Before the semester, I mapped out the semester for both courses, lining up
the material on as many days as possible. Then adjustments were made to keep
the courses on the same schedule while finding room for the additional
material in STAT 210. This alignment was accomplished through additional
out-of-class activities in STAT 210 using presented through online videos
and/or adding additional practice activities for STAT 110.</p>
<p>Written assessments were constructed in the same vein. Each written
assignment shared 4 questions, while the STAT 210 assignments had a
5th question that covered the additional material not covered in STAT
110. Both courses used the same set of practice and regular quizzes.</p>
<p>This approach was a success in two ways. First, I (almost) made it through
that semester with my sanity in tack, but I realized that there is another
advantage to going through the process of aligning these courses. Frequently,
students that have taken STAT 110 will change to a major or minor that
requires STAT 210. In the past, the statistic faculty had a process for
converting a STAT 110 to STAT 210 (a test), but that approach is lost to
time. The following semester, I piloted using the supplementary material
developed for STAT 210 as a “course packet” that completed by one of my
former STAT 110 students that need STAT 210 after a change of major. In the
end, the statistic subgroup decided on an alternative route, I am grateful
for the chance to gain a better understanding of the relationship between
these courses.</p>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>In this section, you have seen evidence of substantial and meaningful
contributions to the curriculum of both the data science and statistics
programs, as well as evidence of my efforts to improve the coding skills of
students.</p>
